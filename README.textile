h1. First whack at a Ruby API for interacting with "Pachube":http://www.pachube.com

h2. Work in progress at this point

Requires version 0.2.0 or greater of the eeml-simple EEML wrapper library.  Thanks to James Smith for including my changes upstream.

Take a peek at the test cases for examples of how to consume/contribute to Pachube in either EEML XML or EEML objects.

h2. Wants

To support the whole API, I don't need it all yet.  So...if you're interested fork away or let me know how I can help.
